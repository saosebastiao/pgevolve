# Object kinds

Every top-level Postgres object kind pgevolve does, will, or won't
manage. See [`../README.md`](./README.md) for the status legend.

## Tables and schemas — core surface

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SCHEMA` | ✅ Implemented | `CREATE / DROP / COMMENT ON`. Schemas are listed in `[managed].schemas`; everything outside the list is ignored by the differ and lint. change_kinds: [create, drop, alter, comment_on] |
| `TABLE` | ✅ Implemented | `CREATE / DROP / ALTER` for every v0.1 column / constraint operation. See [`column-types.md`](./column-types.md) and [`constraints.md`](./constraints.md) for nested capability. Column reorder is detected but not yet applied. change_kinds: [create, drop, alter, comment_on] |
| `INDEX` | ✅ Implemented | Six access methods; partial, expression, INCLUDE, NULLS NOT DISTINCT, opclass, collation, tablespace. See [`indexes.md`](./indexes.md). change_kinds: [create, drop, recreate, set_comment] |
| `SEQUENCE` | ✅ Implemented | `CREATE / DROP / ALTER`. `OWNED BY` modeled. Identity-backing sequences derived from `SERIAL` / `GENERATED AS IDENTITY` columns. change_kinds: [create, drop, alter, comment_on] |
| `COMMENT` | ✅ Implemented | On schemas, tables, columns, indexes, sequences, constraints. change_kinds: [comment_on] |
| Inheritance (`INHERITS`) | ⛔ Not planned | Declarative partitioning supersedes inheritance for v0.1's target use cases. |

## Partitioning

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Declarative partitioned table (`PARTITION BY`) | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Range, list, hash partition strategies. Each partition is a `Table` with a `partition_of` parent. |
| Partition attach / detach | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | `ATTACH PARTITION` / `DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` lands with declarative partitioning. |
| Partition pruning at plan time | 🔮 Future | Plan can skip unaffected partitions when a change touches only the parent; v0.2 first ships the basic case. |

## Views

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VIEW` | ✅ Implemented | Stored SQL view. `NormalizedBody::from_sql` canonicalizes the SELECT body on both the source side (T3/T4 parse pass) and the catalog side (T5 catalog reader), so cosmetically-different views diff equal. `security_barrier` and `security_invoker` reloptions are modeled. change_kinds: [create, drop, replace_compatible, replace_incompatible, set_reloption, set_comment] |
| `MATERIALIZED VIEW` | ✅ Implemented | Physically-stored view. `WITH NO DATA` initial state honored. `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` step kind lands with the planner; upgraded to `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` under online strategy when the MV has a unique index (`refresh_mv_concurrently = true`). change_kinds: [create, drop, replace_body, refresh, set_comment] |
| `security_barrier` reloption | ✅ Implemented | Modeled as `View::security_barrier: Option<bool>`. Emitted as `ALTER VIEW … SET (security_barrier = …)` via the `alter_view_set_reloption` step kind. |
| `security_invoker` reloption | ✅ Implemented | Modeled as `View::security_invoker: Option<bool>`. Same step kind as `security_barrier`. |
| `CREATE VIEW ... WITH CHECK OPTION` | 🔮 Future | Plumbed alongside views; defaults off. |
| Recursive views (`WITH RECURSIVE`) | 🔮 Future | Requires cycle-aware dep-graph handling. |

## Functions, procedures, triggers

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `FUNCTION` (SQL language body) | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Source-side: function definitions live in `schema/<schema>/functions/<name>.sql`. Replace-on-change semantics. |
| `FUNCTION` (PL/pgSQL body) | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Same model as SQL functions; body is opaque text canonicalized to a normal form for diff. |
| `FUNCTION` (other PL languages — PL/Python, PL/Perl, etc.) | 🔮 Future | Requires support for `CREATE EXTENSION` for the language first. |
| `PROCEDURE` | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Same shape as functions. |
| `TRIGGER` | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Both row- and statement-level; before/after/instead-of. Constraint triggers as a subkind. |
| `EVENT TRIGGER` | 🔮 Future | Lower priority; intersects with admin/security tooling. |
| `AGGREGATE` | 🔮 Future | Custom aggregates require user-defined functions; lands with PL languages. |

## Custom types

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ENUM` (`CREATE TYPE ... AS ENUM`) | ✅ Implemented | `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE [BEFORE\|AFTER]`, `RENAME VALUE`. Dropping or reordering values triggers `ReplaceWithCascade` (`DROP TYPE CASCADE` + `CREATE TYPE`). change_kinds: [create, drop, alter_type_add_value, alter_type_rename_value, comment_on, replace_with_cascade] |
| `DOMAIN` (`CREATE DOMAIN`) | ✅ Implemented | `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, default. `ALTER DOMAIN ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT`, `SET/DROP DEFAULT`, `SET/DROP NOT NULL`. Base-type change triggers `ReplaceWithCascade`. change_kinds: [create, drop, alter_domain_add_constraint, alter_domain_drop_constraint, alter_domain_set_default, alter_domain_set_not_null, comment_on, replace_with_cascade] |
| `COMPOSITE TYPE` (`CREATE TYPE ... AS (...)`) | ✅ Implemented | `ADD ATTRIBUTE`, `DROP ATTRIBUTE`, `ALTER ATTRIBUTE TYPE`. Attribute reordering triggers `ReplaceWithCascade`. change_kinds: [create, drop, alter_type_add_attribute, alter_type_drop_attribute, alter_type_alter_attribute_type, comment_on, replace_with_cascade] |
| `RANGE TYPE` (`CREATE TYPE ... AS RANGE`) | 🔮 Future | Lands when range-typed columns become first-class. |
| `BASE TYPE` (`CREATE TYPE ... ( INPUT = ..., OUTPUT = ... )`) | ⛔ Not planned | Requires C-language functions; out of scope. |

## Extensions

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `EXTENSION` | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Source-side: extensions listed in `pgevolve.toml`'s `[extensions]` block with version pins. `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS`. The objects an extension creates are *not* managed by pgevolve — they're owned by the extension. |
| Extension version upgrade (`ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE`) | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Lands with extensions; respects per-version SQL scripts. |

## Security and roles

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ROLE` (`CREATE ROLE / USER`) | 📋 Planned, v0.3 | Membership and inheritance modeled. `LOGIN` attribute kept. Passwords are *not* stored in source — set out-of-band. |
| `GRANT` / `REVOKE` (object permissions) | 📋 Planned, v0.3 | Per-object grant lists in IR; diff produces minimal GRANT/REVOKE sequences. Default privileges (`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`) included. |
| Row-level security policies (`POLICY`) | 📋 Planned, v0.3 | Including `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` toggle on tables. |
| Security barriers / leakproof flags | 🔮 Future | Less commonly used; lands alongside fine-grained policy review. |
| `SECURITY LABEL` | ⛔ Not planned | Used primarily by SE-Linux integration; out of scope. |

## Replication and federation

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLICATION` | 🔮 Future | Logical replication source-side metadata. |
| `SUBSCRIPTION` | 🔮 Future | Logical replication consumer; connection strings introduce secrets-management questions. |
| `FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER` (`FDW`) | 🔮 Future | First-class FDW lifecycle (`CREATE SERVER`, `USER MAPPING`, `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`). |
| `FOREIGN TABLE` | 🔮 Future | Lands with FDWs. |

## Storage and physical layout

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TABLESPACE` | 🔮 Future | The IR carries the `tablespace` attribute on tables and indexes, but pgevolve does not create / drop tablespaces — they're cluster-level admin objects outside the schema-management remit. |
| `TABLE ... USING <access method>` | 🔮 Future | Custom table access methods (zheap, columnar, etc.). |
| `WITH (storage_parameter = ...)` (table reloptions) | 🟡 Partial | The IR doesn't yet model `fillfactor`, autovacuum overrides, etc. Planned for v0.2. change_kinds: [alter] |
| Toast options (`STORAGE EXTERNAL` / `EXTENDED` / `PLAIN` / `MAIN`) | 📋 Planned, v0.2 | Per-column toast strategy lands with extended `[storage]` modeling. |

## Operators, casts, collations, text search

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OPERATOR` / `OPERATOR CLASS` / `OPERATOR FAMILY` | 🔮 Future | Heavy admin objects; lower priority than user-facing surface. |
| `CAST` | 🔮 Future | Custom casts; lands with custom types. |
| `COLLATION` | 🟡 Partial | Per-column collation **is** modeled in v0.1; `CREATE COLLATION` (defining new collations) is 🔮 Future. change_kinds: [alter] |
| `TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION` / `DICTIONARY` / `PARSER` / `TEMPLATE` | 🔮 Future | Lands with full-text-search-aware index methods (`gin` is already supported as a method but text-search dictionaries are not modeled). |

## Statistics, rules, and other helpers

| Object | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STATISTICS` (`CREATE STATISTICS`) | 📋 Planned, v0.3 | Multi-column statistics objects (`ndistinct`, `dependencies`, `mcv`). |
| `RULE` | ⛔ Not planned | Largely superseded by triggers; pg_query already discourages new rules. |
| `SERVER` (FDW server) | 🔮 Future | Lands with FDWs. |
| `USER MAPPING` | 🔮 Future | Lands with FDWs. |

## What `pgevolve` deliberately does not manage

| Object | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE` itself | ⛔ Not planned | Database creation is a cluster-admin step; pgevolve assumes the DB exists. |
| `TABLESPACE` directories | ⛔ Not planned | Filesystem-level setup. |
| Cluster-wide settings (`postgresql.conf`) | ⛔ Not planned | Different lifecycle and audit story. |
| Backups, restores, and physical replication | ⛔ Not planned | Outside the schema-management remit. |
| Data itself (row contents) | ⛔ Not planned | pgevolve plans never `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`. Data migrations are users' responsibility. |
